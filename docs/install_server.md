## General Information

### Minimum Requirements

A fresh linux VM running either Debian 11 or Ubuntu 20.04 LTS with **4GB RAM** on x64 architecture.

!!!warning
    The provided install script assumes a fresh server with no software installed on it. Attempting to run it on an existing server with other services **will** break things and the install will fail.

!!!danger
    The install script sets up a production ready reverse proxy using Nginx which does TLS termination and handles routing all requests to the correct backends, so using another proxy in front of your instance is not necessary (and may break things).<br><br>If you want to use another reverse proxy for whatever reason, such as HAProxy, Traefik or Nginx Proxy Manager, then you will likely need to edit the install script and disable all the steps relating to installing and configuring nginx and configure reverse proxying yourself. You may refer to the Nginx configs in the install script for hints on how to proxy various services to the correct backends. Note that choosing to not use the built in proxy will make your instance officially "unsupported", because the developers do not have the bandwidth to support an infinite amount of setups and need to focus on the actual software. This is not meant to scare you away from doing your own reverse proxy...just something to be aware of. Check [unsupported proxies](unsupported_proxies.md) to see if you need to edit your install script to suit your selected reverse proxy, or if a method that works without doing so has been posted **BEFORE** you install. Read more in the [unsupported](unsupported_guidelines.md) guidelines.

!!!note
    The install script has been tested on the following public cloud providers: DigitalOcean, Linode, Vultr, BuyVM (highly recommended), Hetzner, AWS, Google Cloud and Azure, as well as behind NAT on Hyper-V, ESXi and Proxmox (CT's on Proxmox are [unsupported](unsupported_guidelines.md), only use VMs).

!!!note
    CPU: 1 core is fine for < 200 agents with limited checks/tasks.<br><br>
    Disk space and speed are dependent on your use case. Of course faster is better SSD/NVMe. Space is dependent on how long you're keeping historical data, and how many checks/script runs and their output size. 50GB should be fine for < 12months of history on < 200 agents with < 30 checks/tasks run at reasonable time intervals.

!!!tip
    Enable logging in putty in case you need it later. A good windows SSH client is [MobaXTerm](https://mobaxterm.mobatek.net/download.html). It'll automatically log everything so if you need it later (like install logs because you have a [50x error](troubleshooting.md#problems-after-new-server-install) trying to login after) they'll be easy to grab and share with support. Has integrated SCP client too!

#### Network Requirements

- A real (internet resolvable) domain is needed to generate a Let's Encrypt wildcard cert. _If you cannot afford to purchase a domain ($12 a year) then you can get one for free at [freenom.com](https://www.freenom.com/)_
    - example.local is __NOT__ a real domain. No, you [don't have to expose your server](faq.md#can-i-run-tactical-rmm-locally-behind-nat-without-exposing-anything-to-the-internet) to the internet
- A TOTP based authenticator app. Some popular ones are Google Authenticator, Authy, and Microsoft Authenticator.

#### Update Recommendations

!!!note
    We highly recommend staying current with updates (do not lag behind more than 1 major version) while Tactical RMM is still working towards its 1.0 release.<br/><br/>
    Until we reach production release, there may be architectural changes that may be made to Tactical RMM and only a regular patching schedule is supported by developers.

## Option 1: Easy Install on a VPS

Install on a VPS: DigitalOcean, Linode, Vultr, BuyVM (highly recommended), Hetzner, AWS, Google Cloud and Azure to name a few.

Use something that meets [minimum specs](install_server.md#hardware-os)

### Step 1 - Run Updates on OS

SSH into the server as **root**.

Install the pre-reqs and apply the latest updates:

```bash
apt update
apt install -y wget curl sudo ufw
apt -y upgrade
```

If a new kernel is installed, reboot the server with the `reboot` command.

### Step 2 - Create a Linux user

Create a linux user named `tactical` to run the rmm and add it to the sudoers group.

```bash
useradd -m -G sudo -s /bin/bash tactical
passwd tactical
```

!!!tip
    [Enable passwordless sudo to make your life easier in the future](https://linuxconfig.org/configure-sudo-without-password-on-ubuntu-20-04-focal-fossa-linux)

### Step 3 - Setup the firewall (optional but highly recommended)

!!!info
    Skip this step if your VM is __not__ publicly exposed to the world e.g. running behind NAT. You should setup the firewall rules in your router instead.<br>
    Port 443 TCP: For agents and tech login to rmm and mesh.<br>
    Port 22 TCP: For SSH, server administration only

```bash
ufw default deny incoming
ufw default allow outgoing
ufw allow https
```

!!!info
    SSH (port 22 TCP) is only required for you to remotely login and do basic linux server administration for your rmm. It is not needed for any agent communication.<br/>

???+ note "SSH Firewall Rule"

    === ":material-console-line: Restrict SSH"

        Allow ssh from only allowed IP's (__highly__ recommended)

        ```bash
        ufw allow proto tcp from X.X.X.X to any port 22
        ufw allow proto tcp from X.X.X.X to any port 22
        ```

    === ":material-console-line: Allow all SSH"

        Allow ssh from everywhere (__not__ recommended)

        ```bash
        ufw allow ssh
        ```

Enable and activate the firewall:

```bash
ufw enable && ufw reload
```

!!!note
    You will never login to the server again as `root` again unless something has gone horribly wrong, and you're working with the developers.

### Step 4 - Create the A records

!!!warning
    All 3 domain names have to be at the same subdomain level because you only get one LetsEncrypt wildcard cert, and it'll only apply to that level of DNS name.

We'll be using `example.com` as our domain for this example.

!!!info
    The RMM uses 3 different sites. The Vue frontend e.g. `rmm.example.com` which is where you'll be accessing your RMM from the browser, the REST backend e.g. `api.example.com` and MeshCentral e.g. `mesh.example.com`

1. Get the public IP of your server with `curl https://icanhazip.tacticalrmm.io`
2. Open the DNS manager of wherever the domain you purchased is hosted.
3. Create 3 A records: `rmm`, `api` and `mesh` and point them to the public IP of your server:

![arecords](images/arecords.png)

### Step 5 - Run the install script

Switch to the `tactical` user:

```bash
su - tactical
```

!!!tip
    If you can snapshot do that now so you can quickly restore to this point again and re-run the install in case something goes wrong with the install script.

Download and run the install script:

```bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/amidaware/tacticalrmm/master/install.sh
chmod +x install.sh
./install.sh
```

Answer the initial questions when prompted. Replace `example.com` with your domain.

![questions](images/install_questions.png)

### Step 6 - Deploy the TXT record in your DNS manager for Let's Encrypt [wildcard certs](https://letsencrypt.org/docs/challenge-types/#dns-01-challenge)

!!!warning
    TXT records can take anywhere from 1 minute to a few hours to propagate depending on your DNS provider.<br/>
    You should verify the TXT record has been deployed first before pressing Enter.<br/>
    A quick way to check is with the following command:<br/> `dig -t txt _acme-challenge.example.com`<br/>
    or test using: <https://viewdns.info/dnsrecord/> Enter: `_acme-challenge.example.com`

![txtrecord](images/txtrecord.png)

![dnstxt](images/dnstxt.png)

Create a login for the RMM web UI:

![rmmlogin](images/rmmlogin.png)

A bunch of URLS / usernames / passwords will be printed out at the end of the install script. **Save these somewhere safe.** [Recover them if you didn't](faq.md#how-do-i-recover-my-meshcentral-login-credentials)

### Step 7 - Login

Navigate to `https://rmm.example.com` and login with the username/password you created during install.

Once logged in, you will be redirected to the initial setup page.

Create your first client/site and choose the default timezone.

You're Done

[Update Regularly](install_server.md#update-regularly)

## Option 2: Install Behind NAT Router

Install in your local network using: Dedicated hardware, Hyper-V, Proxmox or ESXi. All been tested and work fine.

Do everything from [Option 1: Easy Install](install_server.md#run-updates-and-setup-the-linux-user)

#### If You Only Have Agents on the Private Network / Subnet

Make sure your local DNS server (or agents hosts file) have your Tactical RMM server IP addresses for the 3 domain names: `rmm`, `api` and `mesh`

#### Agents Exist Outside the Private Network / Subnet - Setup Port Forwarding

If you have agents outside your local network: Make sure the public DNS servers have A records for the 3 Tactical RMM server domain names: `rmm`, `api` and `mesh`

Login to your router / NAT device.

1. Set your TRMM server as a static IP (Using a DHCP reservation is usually safer).
2. Port forward `TCP 443` to your TRMM servers private IP address.

!!!note
    <https://portforward.com/> can help with Port Forwarding setup

**You're Done**

[Update Regularly](install_server.md#update-regularly)

## Option 3: Installs by Network Wizards

Use the scripts above.

### Requirements

1. TLD domain name which is internet resolvable (this is for a LetsEncrypt DNS wildcard request during the install script [validated by DNS txt record](https://letsencrypt.org/docs/challenge-types/#dns-01-challenge)).
    - Test using: <https://viewdns.info/dnsrecord/> or <https://dnschecker.org/>. Enter: `_acme-challenge.example.com` as `TXT`
2. Agents need to be able to connect to your server via DNS lookup (hosts file, local DNS, smoke signals etc.).
    - Test from agent: `ping rmm.example.com`. Should result in the IP of your Tactical RMM server.
    - Test from agent: `ping api.example.com`. Should result in the IP of your Tactical RMM server.
    - Test from agent: `ping mesh.example.com`. Should result in the IP of your Tactical RMM server.

!!!note
    Did you notice #2 doesn't need to be something publicly available?

That's it. You're a wizard, you know how to satisfy these 2 items.

You'll probably enjoy browsing thru the [Unsupported section](unsupported_guidelines.md) of the docs.

## Update Regularly

We've said it before, we'll say it again.

- We recommend regular updates.

    - Every 2-3 months.

        - Do it when you update your SSL certs. 

Especially don't get behind 2 major rev's. Lots of agent connectivity changes occurring. If you don't keep up, you'll be needing to do manual updates by adjusting the `updates.sh` and specifying older branches...then doing update, wait for all agents to get updated...then do the next major branch, then wait for agent updates...until you're current. Can we say **#Painful**.
