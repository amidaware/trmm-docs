## Backing up the RMM

!!!note
    This is only applicable for the standard install, not Docker installs.

A backup script is provided for quick and easy way to backup all settings into one file to move to another server.

Download and run the backup script:

```bash
wget -N https://raw.githubusercontent.com/amidaware/tacticalrmm/master/backup.sh
chmod +x backup.sh
./backup.sh
```

The backup tar file will be saved in `/rmmbackups` with the following format:

`rmm-backup-CURRENTDATETIME.tar`

## Schedule to run Daily via Cron

To schedule automated daily backups run the script with the `--schedule` flag
```bash
./backup.sh --schedule
```
This will do the following:
* Create daily, weekly and monthly folders under /rmmbackup.
* Schedule backups using cron to run at midnight every night.
* As well as Daily backups, there are monthly backups on the 10th day of every month and weekly backups every Friday.
* Automated pruning of backup files, daily kept for 2 weeks, weekly for 2 months and monthly for 1 year. 

!!!warning
    The backup script will just save to your server drive, you ideally want to automate moving this to another server. Please ensure you have space for the backups to be stored.
