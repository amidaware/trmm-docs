# Troubleshooting

## I just updated and now it doesn't work.

It's just a blank white screen, nothing will load when I refresh. [See](faq.md#i-just-updated-and-now-it-doesnt-work).

## Server Troubleshooting Script

If you've asked for help in [#support](https://discord.com/channels/736478043522072608/744282073870630912) please run this, and send a screenshot at the top of the thread created for troubleshooting your issue.

Blur your domains if you desire privacy (or DM the person that's helping you to make everyones life easier).

First, ensure that dig is installed via the dnsutils package:

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y dnsutils
```

Next, download and run the troubleshooting script:

```bash
wget -N https://raw.githubusercontent.com/amidaware/tacticalrmm/develop/troubleshoot_server.sh
chmod +x troubleshoot_server.sh
./troubleshoot_server.sh
```

!!!note
    If you're working with a support person please provide the full script output. If you don't want to post publicly, feel free to DM the person working with you in Discord #support channel

## Make sure DNS (name resolution) was setup properly

### From the agent

Open command prompt:

```cmd
ping rmm.example.com
ping api.example.com
ping mesh.example.com
```

The IP address for all 3 should reflect your Tactical RMM server.

## Problems after new server install

In the very unlikely event you have issues after install please wipe the box and install again (following all the steps including downloading the install script _but not running it yet_) use the following command which will log the install progress and if you continue to have issues will assist with support of the installation.

```bash
bash -x install.sh 2>&1 | tee install.log
```

!!!note
    Logging of installs isn’t desirable as it logs extremely sensitive information which is why this isn’t done by default! **Do not** post the raw log publicly only provide it if requested and then by dm only.

## "Bad credentials" error when trying to login to the web UI

If you are sure you are using the correct credentials and still getting a "bad credentials" error, open your browser's dev tools (++ctrl+shift+j++ on Chrome) and check the Console tab to see the real error.

It will most probably be a CORS error which means you need to check your DNS settings and make sure whatever computer you're trying to access the UI from resolves your 3 subdomains to the correct IP of the server running the RMM (public IP if running in the cloud, or private IP if running behind NAT).

If you see an error about SSL or certificate expired, then your Let's Encrypt cert has probably expired and you'll need to renew it.

Refer to the Let's Encrypt cert renewal instructions [here](update_server.md#keeping-your-lets-encrypt-certificate-up-to-date).

## Agents not installing or updating

The most common problem we've seen of agents not installing or updating is due to Antivirus blocking the updater executable.

Windows Defender will 100% of the time block the updater from running unless an exclusion is set.

Refer to the [Agent Installation](install_agent.md) instructions for AV exceptions to set and manually doing an agent update with logging to troubleshoot further.

Agents will also not automatically update if they are too old.

Since Tactical RMM is still in beta and the developers makes breaking changes pretty frequently, there is no promise of backwards compatibility.

If you have agents that are relatively old, you will need to uninstall them manually and reinstall using the latest version.

The mesh installer is created at time of install. Make sure it's working by running this on your TRMM server. 

???+ note "Check TRMM connection to MeshCentral"

    === ":material-console-line: Standard Install"

        ```bash
        /rmm/api/env/bin/python /rmm/api/tacticalrmm/manage.py check_mesh
        ```

    === ":material-docker: docker"

        ```bash

!!!warning
    As of v0.12.0 `Error 1005` usually means something doesn't match and / or the mesh username has to be all lower case.<br>
    If you customize the "Mesh Device Group Name" in Tactical's settings you **MUST** also manually match that Mesh Group in mesh itself [because you must understand](mesh_integration.md#security-implications).

## Agents not checking in or showing up / General agent issues

Eg. Agent Boot time: 53 years ago

These are NATS problems. Try the quick fixes first:

### From Admin Web Interface

First, reload NATS from Tactical's web UI:<br>
**Tools > Server Maintenance > Reload Nats Configuration**

If that doesn't work, check each part starting with the server:

### Server SSH login

Reload NATS:

```bash
/rmm/api/env/bin/python /rmm/api/tacticalrmm/manage.py reload_nats
sudo systemctl restart nats.service
```

Look at NATS service errors (make sure it's running):

```bash
sudo systemctl status nats.service
```

If NATS isn't running see detailed reason why it isn't:

```bash
sudo systemctl stop nats.service
nats-server -DVV -c /rmm/api/tacticalrmm/nats-rmm.conf
```

Fix the problem, then restart NATS:

```
sudo systemctl restart nats.service
```

### From Agent Install

Open CMD as admin on the problem computer and stop the agent services:

```cmd
net stop tacticalrmm
```

Run the tacticalrmm service manually with debug logging:

```cmd
"C:\Program Files\TacticalAgent\tacticalrmm.exe" -m rpc -log debug -logto stdout
```

This will print out a ton of info. You should be able to see the error from the debug log output.

Please then copy / paste the logs and post them either in our [Discord support chat](https://discord.gg/upGTkWp), or create a [github issue](https://github.com/amidaware/tacticalrmm/issues).

If all else fails, simply uninstall the agent either from control panel or silently with `"C:\Program Files\TacticalAgent\unins000.exe" /VERYSILENT` and then reinstall the agent.

## All other errors

First, run the [update script](update_server.md#updating-to-the-latest-rmm-version) with the `--force` flag.

This will fix permissions and reinstall python / node packages that might have gotten corrupted.

```bash
./update.sh --force
```

Check the debug log from the web UI: **File > Debug Log**

Open your browser's dev tools (++ctrl+shift+j++ on Chrome) and check the Console tab for any errors.

Check all the systemd services that the rmm uses to function and check to make sure they're all active / running and enabled:

```bash
sudo systemctl status rmm.service
sudo systemctl status daphne.service
sudo systemctl status celery.service
sudo systemctl status celerybeat.service
sudo systemctl status nginx.service
sudo systemctl status nats.service
sudo systemctl status nats-api.service
sudo systemctl status meshcentral.service
sudo systemctl status mongod.service
sudo systemctl status postgresql.service
sudo systemctl status redis-server.service
```

Or you can use `systemctl --failed` to see any failed services on your machine.

Read through the log files in the following folders and check for errors:

```bash
/rmm/api/tacticalrmm/tacticalrmm/private/log
/var/log/celery
```

## Using Cloudflare DNS

- rmm.example.com can be proxied.

- api.example.com can be proxied when using (the default) agent configuration which utilizes websockets.

- mesh.example.com can be proxied with the caveat that Mesh checks the cert presented to the agent is the same one on the server. I.e. no MITM. You'll need to copy Cloudflare's edge cert (they call it Origin Server) to your server if you want to proxy this domain.

If you're getting `Invalid group id` at the end of the install you're probably doing something wrong / wrong IP for api.

## Testing network connectivity between agent and server

Use powershell, make sure you can connect to 443 from agent to server:

```powershell
Test-NetConnection -ComputerName api.example.com -Port 443
```

Check your SSL certs to make sure they are what they should be (no proxy stuff): <https://www.digicert.com/help/>

Are you trying to use a reverse proxy to share your single public IP with multiple services on 443? This is complicated and [unsupported by Tactical RMM](unsupported_scripts.md). Test your setup.

## Take Control or Remote Background missing button / can't connect

This is a MeshCentral connection problem.

1. Don't use Firefox (test in vanilla Chrome first).
2. Open `mesh.domain.com` and see if the agent is listed there.
3. If you don't see your agent (or it's offline), restart TRMM server (or [service](howitallworks.md#meshcentral)).
4. Restart Mesh Agent on client PC. 
5. Check again. Still not appearing in `mesh.domain.com` in Mesh go to **"My Server" > Trace tab > Click tracing button > Check MeshAgent traffic**.
6. Restart Mesh Agent on client PC. You should see something in trace like ![mesh trace](images/mesh_trace.png).
7. If you don't, you have firewall / connectivity issues (open `mesh.domain.com` from agent and troubleshoot. You aren't using a proxy right?).

## Need to recover your Mesh token?

Login to server with SSH and run:

```bash
node /meshcentral/node_modules/meshcentral --logintokenkey
```

## Mesh Agent not connecting to server

When agents don't show up in your Mesh console (after logging into https://mesh.EXAMPLE.COM), and all data is blank. Your AV has most likely blocked the agent.

![Mesh Not Connecting](images/mesh_no_data.png)

## Error 500

These are always logged to `/rmm/api/tacticalrmm/tacticalrmm/private/log/django_debug.log` use [this](howitallworks.md#log-files) to check.

## Can't login on server after first setup

You're sure you're typing in everything right, giving it 2FA code, and getting error 400 login error.

[TOTP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time-based_one-time_password) is time sensitive, check your time/NTP and make sure it's right! :)

## Error 0:

If you're trying to login [check dns](https://github.com/amidaware/tacticalrmm/issues/1136), [check server and client time](https://docs.tacticalrmm.com/troubleshooting/#cant-login-on-server-after-first-setup), and check your certs.

## executable file not found in %PATH%

This error can show up for Powershell or choco.

- `exec: "Powershell": executable file not found in %PATH%`
- `exec: "choco.exe": executable file not found in %PATH%`
- `choco : The term 'choco' is not recognized as the name of a cmdlet`

Run the [Win_Powershell_TestPATH.bat](https://github.com/amidaware/community-scripts/blob/main/scripts/Win_Powershell_TestPATH.bat) script to gather information about your environment. This script will output either `ExpandString` or `String`. See [Microsoft's docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/sysinfo/registry-value-types) for details.

- **ExpandString** (REG_EXPAND_SZ) means `%SystemRoot%` will expand to `C:\Windows`. Reboot and choco will most likely work.
- **String** (REG_SZ) means `%SystemRoot%` will not be expanded. Changing the registry value type will most likely work.

!!!note
    If your path does not have Path variables like `%SystemRoot%`, the registry type does not matter because the paths are already expanded.

If the script outputs "String", changing the registry type and restarting the Tactical service will most likely work. This script will output the value type and the $PATH. Make note of the $PATH because `Set-ItemProperty` needs the value to change the type. Run this as administrator and uncomment `Set-ItemProperty` to change the registry type to ExpandString. Run the first two commands to get the type and $PATH to make sure everything is good. Restart the TacticalRMM service and try the command again.

```PowerShell
$kind = (Get-Item -Path 'Registry::HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\Session Manager\Environment').GetValueKind('PATH')
Write-Output "Path kind before the change: ${kind}"

$path = Get-ItemPropertyValue -Path 'Registry::HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\Session Manager\Environment' -Name Path
Write-Output "Path before changing the type:", $path

Write-Output "Changing the registry key type"
# Needs to be run as administrator
# Set-ItemProperty -Path 'Registry::HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\Session Manager\Environment' -Name PATH -Value $path -Type ExpandString
Write-Output ""

$kind = (Get-Item -Path 'Registry::HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\Session Manager\Environment').GetValueKind('PATH')
Write-Output "Path kind after the change: ${kind}"

$path = Get-ItemPropertyValue -Path 'Registry::HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\Session Manager\Environment' -Name Path
Write-Output "Path after changing the type:", $path
```

## Issues with agents offline after reboot or new install on AWS and other cloud platforms using cloudinit or similar

1. Run `cat /etc/hosts`
2. If the output shows that the hosts file is managed by another process follow the instructions to change the config.
3. Add in your api, rmm and mesh urls on the line for 127.0.1.1 in the hosts file
4. Save the hosts file
5. Restart services or run `update.sh --force`
